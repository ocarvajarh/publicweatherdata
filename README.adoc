= Weather data service
This service connects to Google Compute Platform and retrieves weather information
to be displayed on a map.

== Information used to query the service

== How to enable Google Big Query

=== Create web application credentials
First, you need to allow the server side code to connect to your Google API. For this
you will need a *service account*, which is an account that belongs to your application
instead of to an individual end user. The application calls Google APIs on behalf of the
service account, so users aren't directly involved.

To support server-to-server interactions, first create a service account for your project in the API Console

Then, your application prepares to make authorized API calls by using the service account's credentials to request an access token from the OAuth 2.0 auth server.

Finally, your application can use the access token to call Google APIs.

==== Creating a service account
A service account's credentials include a generated email address that is unique and at least one public/private key pair.

If your application doesn't run on Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine, you must obtain these credentials in the Google API Console. To generate service-account credentials, or to view the public credentials that you've already generated, do the following:

* Open the link:https://console.developers.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts[Service accounts page]. If prompted, select a project.
* Click *Create service account*.
* In the *Create service account* window, type a name for the service account, and select *Furnish a new private key.* Then click *Create*.

Your new public/private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine; it serves as the only copy of this key. You are responsible for storing it securely.

You can return to the link:https://console.developers.google.com/[API Console] at any time to view the email address, public key fingerprints, and other information, or to generate additional public/private key pairs.

Take note of the service account's email address and store the service account's P12 private key file in a location accessible to your application. Your application needs them to make authorized API calls.
